Rendition of "Game of Life" designed to run on Raspberry PI Pico using a Waveshare LCD 1.3 Display


The "Life" game, often referred to as Conway's Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.



Button A: Adds a new cell at a random location.
Button B: Cycles through different color modes.
Button X: Toggles the paused state of the game.
Button Y: Resets the grid to a new random state.
Directional Buttons: Shifts the entire grid in the specified direction.
